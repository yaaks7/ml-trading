# ü§ñ Machine Learning Models Guide

> Comprehensive guide to the ML models used in the trading prediction system: Random Forest and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

## üìã Overview

The system implements two complementary machine learning approaches:
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble tree-based method
- **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**: Neural network approach

Both models are designed for **binary classification** to predict market direction (up/down).

## üå≥ Random Forest

### **Concept**
Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a different subset of the data and features.

### **How It Works**
1. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Create multiple datasets by sampling with replacement
2. **Feature Randomness**: Each tree uses only a random subset of features
3. **Tree Training**: Train decision trees on each bootstrapped dataset
4. **Voting**: Final prediction is the majority vote of all trees

### **Advantages**
- ‚úÖ **Robust to Overfitting**: Ensemble averaging reduces variance
- ‚úÖ **Feature Importance**: Provides insights into which features matter most
- ‚úÖ **Handles Non-linearity**: Can capture complex patterns in data
- ‚úÖ **No Feature Scaling**: Works well with features on different scales
- ‚úÖ **Missing Values**: Handles missing data reasonably well

### **Disadvantages**
- ‚ùå **Less Interpretable**: Harder to understand than single decision tree
- ‚ùå **Memory Usage**: Stores multiple trees, can be memory intensive
- ‚ùå **Prediction Speed**: Slower than single models for prediction

### **Key Parameters**
```python
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=200,    # Number of trees (more = better but slower)
    max_depth=10,        # Maximum tree depth (controls overfitting)
    random_state=42      # For reproducible results
)
```

### **When Random Forest Works Well**
- **Tabular Data**: Excellent for structured financial data
- **Mixed Features**: Handles both continuous and categorical features
- **Feature Interactions**: Captures relationships between technical indicators
- **Noisy Data**: Robust to outliers and noise in market data

## üß† Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

### **Concept**
MLP is a feedforward neural network with multiple layers of neurons. It learns complex non-linear relationships through weighted connections and activation functions.

### **Architecture**
```
Input Layer ‚Üí Hidden Layer(s) ‚Üí Output Layer
[Features] ‚Üí [100 neurons] ‚Üí [2 classes: Up/Down]
```

### **How It Works**
1. **Forward Pass**: Input features flow through network layers
2. **Activation**: Each neuron applies an activation function (ReLU/tanh)
3. **Output**: Final layer produces class probabilities
4. **Backpropagation**: Errors are propagated back to update weights
5. **Iteration**: Process repeats until convergence

### **Advantages**
- ‚úÖ **Universal Approximator**: Can learn any continuous function
- ‚úÖ **Non-linear Patterns**: Excels at complex, non-linear relationships
- ‚úÖ **Adaptive**: Learns representations automatically
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Can handle large datasets effectively

### **Disadvantages**
- ‚ùå **Black Box**: Difficult to interpret learned patterns
- ‚ùå **Overfitting Prone**: Can memorize training data
- ‚ùå **Hyperparameter Sensitive**: Requires careful tuning
- ‚ùå **Training Time**: Can be slow to converge
- ‚ùå **Local Minima**: May get stuck in suboptimal solutions

### **Key Parameters**
```python
MLPClassifier(
    hidden_layer_sizes=(100,),  # Network architecture
    max_iter=1000,             # Training iterations
    random_state=42            # For reproducible results
)
```

### **When MLP Works Well**
- **Complex Patterns**: When relationships are highly non-linear
- **Large Datasets**: Benefits from more training data
- **Feature Interactions**: Automatically discovers feature combinations
- **Time Series**: Can capture temporal dependencies in sequences

## üîç Model Comparison

| Aspect | Random Forest | MLP |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| **Interpretability** | Medium (feature importance) | Low (black box) |
| **Training Speed** | Fast | Slow |
| **Prediction Speed** | Medium | Fast |
| **Overfitting Risk** | Low | High |
| **Feature Engineering** | Less critical | More important |
| **Memory Usage** | High | Medium |

## üìä Feature Importance & Interpretability

### **Random Forest Interpretability**
- **Feature Importance**: Shows which technical indicators are most predictive
- **Tree Visualization**: Individual trees can be visualized (though complex)
- **Permutation Importance**: Alternative feature importance method

### **MLP Interpretability**
- **Weight Analysis**: Examine connection weights (limited insight)
- **Layer Activations**: Visualize intermediate representations
- **SHAP/LIME**: External tools for model explanation

## üéØ Expected Performance Characteristics

### **Random Forest Typical Behavior**
- **Accuracy**: 52-58% on financial data (slightly above random)
- **Stability**: Consistent performance across different periods
- **Feature Usage**: Tends to favor moving averages and trend indicators
- **Overfitting**: Low risk, good generalization

### **MLP Typical Behavior**
- **Accuracy**: 50-60% on financial data (higher variance)
- **Volatility**: Performance can vary significantly between runs
- **Feature Usage**: Uses all features but relationships are hidden
- **Overfitting**: Higher risk, requires careful validation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### **Random Forest Pitfalls**
1. **Too Many Trees**: Diminishing returns after ~200 trees
2. **Max Depth Too High**: Can still overfit with very deep trees
3. **Ignoring Feature Importance**: Missing insights into what drives predictions

### **MLP Pitfalls**
1. **Network Too Large**: Overfitting on small financial datasets
2. **Too Few Iterations**: Underfitting due to early stopping
3. **Poor Feature Scaling**: Neural networks sensitive to feature scales
4. **No Regularization**: Overfitting without dropout or L1/L2 penalties

## üîß Hyperparameter Tuning Guidelines

### **Random Forest Tuning**
```python
# Start with these ranges
n_estimators: [100, 200, 500]
max_depth: [5, 10, 15, None]
min_samples_split: [2, 5, 10]
min_samples_leaf: [1, 2, 5]
```

### **MLP Tuning**
```python
# Start with these ranges
hidden_layer_sizes: [(50,), (100,), (100, 50)]
learning_rate: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
alpha: [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01]  # L2 regularization
max_iter: [1000, 2000, 5000]
```

## üìà Model Selection Guidelines

### **Choose Random Forest When:**
- You need interpretable results
- Working with small to medium datasets
- Want stable, consistent performance
- Feature importance is crucial for analysis

### **Choose MLP When:**
- You have large amounts of training data

- Willing to sacrifice interpretability for potential performance
- Have time for extensive hyperparameter tuning

### **Use Both When:**
- You want comprehensive analysis
- Different models may capture different patterns
- Ensemble methods can combine their strengths
- You need to validate results across different approaches
